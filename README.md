# 19 Dec 2017 Notes

Loaded a few of the starting files for registration, login, and functions.. Current coding will be greatly optimized for security/speed. Just getting the generic structure started mainly and a lot of the basic coding started so that I can begin to get an idea on what functions will be necessary, tweaked, etc..


# ndphp
A (slowly built) fantasy based text RPG, with wizards and dragons and sorcerers and knights, PVP combat, quests, and much, much more.

# The Background
I grew up a fan of fantasy/RPG games like Dungeons and Dragons, Dark Age of Camelot, Diablo, etc. Years ago, before the internet became incredibly flashy (and fast), there were quite a few of these types of text based games. The best thing about them all was they were incredibly simple to learn and play but complex with the stories, quests, etc. In 2017, these types of RPG's are rare. The ones you can find now are incredibly convoluted, or worse, created to allow those that spend a lot of money to be dominate, allowing new or part time players to step in and immediately match dedicated or full time players.

Don't get me wrong. There are plans to EVENTUALLY integrate revenue streams, but they will not be insta-god-mode purchases. The point of RPG's, at least when I was a kid, was to plan out a character and develop them over time. This game will remain true to those style games.

# The System
This game will be built to run solely on PHP 7/MySQL. 
I understand the benefits of writing PDO and compatibility with multiple databases. Maybe one day it will be rewritten. Maybe one day someone else will join in or fork and convert or who really knows, but it won't be me for a long, long time, if ever.

# What Will Be Included
Advanced Quest Systems - Probably the most important part in a GOOD RPG. Lots of quests. Some easy. Some hard. Some quick. Some fast. There will be in depth quests, plain and simple. And, over time, there will be a LOT of them.

PVP - Probably second most important in online RPG's.. I want a battle arena where players go head to head, turn based combat. A betting system, trash talk, everything. 

Monsters - Yes. Lots and lots of different style monsters to beat up, each offering chances at gold, xp, item drops, etc.

Equipment - Random equipment drops. Equipment that will almost never repeat in stats so there can always be a chance to improve.

The other stuff - Guilds, item renaming, chat, casinos, games, whatever else I can think of as I develop the game.
